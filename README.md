# EEG-Emotion-Detection
[Emotions](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.758212/full) are closely related to human behavior, family, and society. Changes in emotions can cause differences in electroencephalography (EEG) signals, which show different emotional states and are not easy to disguise. EEG-based emotion recognition has been widely used in human-computer interaction, medical diagnosis, military, and other fields.
